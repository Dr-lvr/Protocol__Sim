# TEST the PRE-RELEASE!

The test simply consists of an executable in java 1.8

# Protocol__Sim
The network simulator is a small framework that can allow
to implement networking logics in a simulative java environment

I tried to make the mechanics as simple and flexible as possible 
so that it can be easy to implement more complex mechanisms 
(protocols, devices, real-time query)

##todo:
* write some default configuration for demostration purposes
* diversify devices (computer, hub, switch, router)
* implement device status dialogs
* implement connection simulations starting from the most obsolete (ex. via hubs)
